Ruby on Sails - Sailing the Waves of Google with Ruby!

(aka: Google Wave provider, implemented in Ruby, with a Ruby on Rails interface)

Ruby on Sails isn't really set up for sidespread setups (or even sending to a
friend). You'll notice the wave.danopia.net folder, this is the rails app. The
main provider file, xmpp_component.rb, requires a file from the rails site, so
you'll have to update the paths.

It's easiest to use Sails when you already have a XMPP server that Fedone can
connect to. To set up Openfire, follow these directions:

Sails also [attempts to] sign deltas, so you'll need to create certs for it to
use. It uses "#{domain}.cert" and "#{domain}.key", which is what is given to
you if you follow Google's instructions to create certs:

<http://code.google.com/p/wave-protocol/wiki/Certificates>

Finally, you'll have to config the XMPP component. YOu need to edit the .rb to
do this, until I add YAML config file reading.
